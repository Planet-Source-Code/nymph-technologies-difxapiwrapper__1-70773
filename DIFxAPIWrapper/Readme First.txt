Hi,

The inf files in the test project "C:\Test Project\PlugAndPlay\toastpkg.inf" and "C:\Test Project\ClassFilter\ClassAFilterDriver.inf" is from the DiFXAPI package, i only added it for testing purposes.. i tested the dll with my network card and it worked fine.. 

You can download the DriverInstallationTools from the folwing link.
