i could not find the values for some of the difxapi.dll return codes. so the error handling is incomplete. most of the return codes that are in the difxapi.h is added. but some from the difxapi documentation is missing. there values are not in the difxapi.h files. i tried to find these values from the web. some of them i found but some not. the ones i found is already added.

below is the list of missing return codes

ERROR_MISSING_FILE
TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE
CERT_E_WRONG_USAGE
CRYPT_E_FILE_ERROR
ERROR_INVALID_CATALOG_DATA
ERROR_SIGNATURE_OSATTRIBUTE_MISMATCH
ERROR_IN_WOW64
ERROR_NO_DEVICE_ID
ERROR_DEPENDENT_APPLICATIONS_EXIST 
ERROR_DRIVER_PACKAGE_NOT_IN_STORE

if you know or if you know where to find the values for above return codes i will be very grateful. please let me know via PSC or email: niucker@gmail.com Thank You.
